# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

For my final project I plan to create a text adventure game in python. As a Statistical Science and Data Analytics major, I originally thought about performing a 
statistical analysis on a selected data set and including figures/graphs, but I feel like creating a text adventure will help me gain a better understanding of 
concepts such as for loops, if else statements, and function writing. Plus, I think it will be more fun to create. I loved these style of books/games when I was 
younger, so creating one of my own while also mastering important concepts seems like a good proposal. I am a big fan of open world rpg's, and I am currently playing
through the 2010 game Fallout: New Vegas, in which the character inhabits a post-apocalyptic Nevada/California desert. As a preliminary idea, I would like to create a 
text adventure using the New Vegas theme, with a "wasteland wanderer" roaming the desert and making decisions to try to survive.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I will be working on this assignment by myself. 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

One question I have is, if I chose to not do the text adventure, would a statistical analysis be acceptable for this assingment? My original plan was
to chose an interesting dataset and approach it as a regression problem, creating linear/logistic regression models and graphs, but I wasn't sure if that met all
the requirements for the final project. I am still leaning towards the text adventure since I think it would be more interesting, but I was curious if the statistical
approach was allowed.
